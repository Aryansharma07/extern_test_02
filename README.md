## Description
Firebase Email and Password Sign-In and Registration
This project demonstrates how to implement Firebase Email and Password Authentication for user sign-in and registration in an Android app. Firebase provides a powerful and secure authentication system that allows users to sign in using their email and password or register a new account if they don't have one yet.

## Features

1)User Registration: New users can sign up for the app by providing their email address and a password. Firebase securely stores the user's account credentials.
2)User Sign-In: Existing users can sign in to the app using their registered email and password.
3)Authentication State Management: The app efficiently manages the user's authentication state, allowing access to specific features only to authenticated users and redirecting unauthenticated users to the sign-in screen.
4)Error Handling: Proper error handling is implemented to handle cases like incorrect passwords, invalid email addresses, network errors, etc.
